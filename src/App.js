            I currently work on various side projects, tinkering with AI coding agents to make AI-powered tools. My latest is doodle, if you'd like to check it out. I used to work as a data analyst at Block (aka Square). Previously, I worked as a frontend engineer at a startup called Premise. And before that, I worked at The Wall Street Journal and NPR as a data and graphics journalist.
